# Worker Service Feature Request

## FEATURE NAME:

Order Processing Pipeline with Inventory Management

---

## FEATURE PURPOSE:

Implement a comprehensive order processing workflow that handles order validation, inventory reservation, payment processing, and fulfillment orchestration using Clean Architecture principles with reliable messaging and comprehensive observability.

---

## CORE FUNCTIONALITY:

- **Order Validation**: Validate incoming orders against business rules and inventory availability
- **Inventory Management**: Reserve inventory items and handle stock level updates
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate with external payment systems with retry and compensation logic
- **Fulfillment Orchestration**: Coordinate shipping, tracking, and notification workflows
- **Saga State Management**: Use MassTransit sagas for long-running order processing workflows

---

## CLEAN ARCHITECTURE LAYERS:

### Domain Layer
- **Order Entity**: Order aggregate with business rules (order validation, status transitions)
- **Product Entity**: Product information with inventory tracking
- **Inventory Value Object**: Stock levels, reservations, and availability calculations
- **OrderStatus Enum**: Pending, Validated, PaymentProcessing, Paid, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled
- **Domain Events**: OrderCreated, InventoryReserved, PaymentProcessed, OrderShipped

### Application Layer
- **Commands**: CreateOrderCommand, ReserveInventoryCommand, ProcessPaymentCommand, ShipOrderCommand
- **Queries**: GetOrderStatusQuery, GetInventoryLevelsQuery, GetOrderHistoryQuery
- **Handlers**: MediatR command/query handlers with business logic
- **Validators**: FluentValidation for order data, inventory requirements, payment information

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Repositories**: OrderRepository, ProductRepository, InventoryRepository using EF Core
- **MassTransit Consumers**: OrderCreatedConsumer, PaymentProcessedConsumer, ShippingCompletedConsumer
- **External Services**: PaymentGatewayService, ShippingProviderService, NotificationService
- **Saga Implementation**: OrderProcessingSaga for workflow orchestration

### Worker Layer
- **Background Services**: InventoryMonitoringService, OrderTimeoutService, MetricsCollectionService
- **Health Checks**: Order processing status, external service connectivity, saga state consistency

---

## MESSAGING PATTERNS:

### Message Types
- **OrderCreatedEvent**: Triggered when new orders are created
- **InventoryReservationRequested**: Request to reserve inventory items
- **PaymentProcessingRequested**: Request to process payment
- **OrderShippingRequested**: Request to initiate shipping
- **OrderTimeoutEvent**: Triggered for stalled or expired orders

### Consumer Implementations
- **OrderCreatedConsumer**: Validates orders and initiates inventory reservation
- **InventoryReservationConsumer**: Handles inventory checks and reservations
- **PaymentConsumer**: Processes payments with retry logic and compensation
- **ShippingConsumer**: Coordinates with shipping providers and updates tracking

### Saga State Machine
- **OrderProcessingSaga**: Orchestrates the complete order workflow
  - States: Created, InventoryReserved, PaymentProcessing, Paid, Shipped, Completed, Failed
  - Handles timeouts, failures, and compensation actions
  - Maintains order processing state and business workflow logic

---

## DATABASE DESIGN:

### Tables
- **Orders**: OrderId, CustomerId, OrderDate, Status, TotalAmount, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- **OrderItems**: OrderItemId, OrderId, ProductId, Quantity, UnitPrice
- **Products**: ProductId, Name, Description, Price, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- **Inventory**: ProductId, AvailableStock, ReservedStock, ReorderLevel, LastUpdated
- **OrderSaga**: CorrelationId, State, OrderId, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, ExpiresAt

### Relationships
- One-to-Many: Order → OrderItems
- Many-to-One: OrderItem → Product
- One-to-One: Product → Inventory
- One-to-One: Order → OrderSaga (for workflow tracking)

### Repository Patterns
- **IOrderRepository**: GetById, Create, Update, GetOrdersWithItems, GetOrdersByStatus
- **IProductRepository**: GetById, GetByIds, UpdateInventory, GetLowStockProducts
- **IInventoryRepository**: ReserveStock, ReleaseReservation, UpdateAvailableStock

---

## OBSERVABILITY REQUIREMENTS:

### Distributed Tracing
- **Correlation IDs**: Track order processing across all services and consumers
- **Span Attributes**: Order ID, Customer ID, Product IDs, processing stage
- **Custom Spans**: Payment processing duration, inventory check time, shipping API calls

### Metrics Collection
- **Business Metrics**: Orders per minute, average processing time, failure rates
- **Technical Metrics**: Consumer processing rates, database operation durations, external API latency
- **Inventory Metrics**: Stock level changes, reservation rates, low stock alerts

### Structured Logging
- **Order Events**: Order creation, status changes, payment events, shipping updates
- **Error Logging**: Payment failures, inventory shortages, external service timeouts
- **Performance Logging**: Slow operations, high-latency external calls, database bottlenecks

---

## HEALTH CHECKS:

### Application Health
- **Order Processing Status**: Check for stalled orders and saga timeouts
- **Consumer Health**: Verify all MassTransit consumers are processing messages
- **Background Service Health**: Monitor inventory monitoring and timeout services

### Dependency Health
- **RabbitMQ Connectivity**: Message broker connection and queue status
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Connection, query performance, transaction log status
- **External Services**: Payment gateway availability, shipping provider APIs

### Custom Health Checks
- **Inventory Consistency**: Verify stock levels and reservation accuracy
- **Saga State Integrity**: Check for orphaned or inconsistent saga states
- **Message Processing Rates**: Alert on low throughput or processing delays

---

## CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS:

### Connection Strings
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection with proper connection pooling
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ with cluster configuration and failover
- **External Services**: Payment gateway URLs, shipping provider endpoints

### Retry Policies
- **Payment Processing**: Exponential backoff with maximum 3 retries
- **Inventory Operations**: Immediate retry with circuit breaker
- **External API Calls**: Retry with jitter for rate limiting

### Timeout Configuration
- **Order Processing**: 30-minute timeout for complete order workflow
- **Payment Processing**: 2-minute timeout for payment confirmation
- **Shipping Integration**: 5-minute timeout for shipping provider APIs

---

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS:

### Unit Tests
- **Domain Logic**: Order validation, status transitions, business rule enforcement
- **Application Handlers**: Command/query handler logic, validation behavior
- **Repository Logic**: Data access patterns, entity mapping, query optimization

### Integration Tests
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete order processing from creation to delivery
- **Consumer Testing**: MassTransit test harness for message processing validation
- **Database Integration**: Repository patterns with test database
- **Saga Testing**: State machine transitions and timeout handling

### Performance Tests
- **Load Testing**: Order processing under high volume
- **Stress Testing**: System behavior under resource constraints
- **Endurance Testing**: Long-running saga state management

---

## DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS:

### Docker Compose
- **Local Development**: RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Jaeger, Prometheus
