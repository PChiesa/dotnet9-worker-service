# Development Team Workflow Summary: JWT Bearer Token Authentication

**Feature:** JWT Bearer Token Authentication for Orders API  
**Completed:** 2025-07-29  
**Workflow Status:** Successfully Completed ✅

## What Was Accomplished

The development team successfully implemented comprehensive JWT Bearer Token Authentication for the Orders API, providing security protection against anonymous users while maintaining all existing functionality. The implementation includes:

- **Secure Authentication Endpoint**: `/auth/token` endpoint with hardcoded credential validation
- **Protected Orders API**: All `/api/orders` endpoints now require valid JWT authentication
- **Token-Based Security**: JWT tokens with username claims for user identification
- **Clean Architecture Compliance**: Authentication logic properly contained in Worker layer only
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 31 JWT-specific tests with 100% pass rate covering success and failure scenarios
- **Production-Ready Code**: Proper error handling, logging, and Swagger integration
